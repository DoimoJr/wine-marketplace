## Screenshots Directory (`screenshots/`)

- `refunds-page-logged-in.png` - Refunds page after successful login

- `refunds-final-test.png` - Final test state of refunds page

## Usage

### Running Scripts

To run any of the test scripts, use Node.js from the project root:

```bash
node .playwright-mcp/scripts/script-name.js
```

### Adding New Scripts

All future Playwright test scripts and debugging tools should be placed in the `scripts/` directory to keep the project root clean.

### Screenshots

Screenshots are automatically generated by the test scripts and saved to the `screenshots/` directory. Each script typically generates screenshots at key points for debugging purposes.

## Notes

- All scripts assume the development servers are running (API on port 3010, Admin on port 3001)
- Scripts include authentication flows for admin panel testing
- Network request/response monitoring is enabled in most scripts for debugging
- Console error/warning logging is included for troubleshooting
